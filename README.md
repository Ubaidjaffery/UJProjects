Following are the list of Digital Forensic Projects, you may find complete details along with additional projects on the website.

<h1>MALWARE ANALYSIS & THREAT IDENTIFICATION</h1>
Analyze malwares which arrives over the Email, USB media. By examining the file content and meta data, using Sandboxing and online file reverse engineering techniques.!

<h1>FILE SHREDDING</h1>
The project specifically focused on an automated script which helps to shred data from the system permanently and cannot be recovered using Forensic tools, it removes important and critical files from your computer note that the file should not be able to recover by using any Data Recovery Software.

<h1>STATIC & DYNAMIC MALWARE ANALYSIS</h1>
This project is divided into two phases Static and Dynamic, here we will be using malware analysis with advanced static analysis tools PEstudio, EXEinfope, PEid and CFF Explorer are capable of providing more complete information about characteristics of malware, such as the information of malware to infect another programs, as well as modifying the registry and create new files and folders. Whereas on basic methods of malware dynamic analysis can discover DLL of malware, the process of malware inside the system, as well as the network connection performed by malware against the server.

<h1>SECURING SYSTEM FROM RANSOMWARE ATTACK</h1>
Using Automated tool and backing up the last good known configuration of the system. The solution potentially help an OS environment to recover if it is being hit by a Ransomware attack. Here we have proposed the solution called Deep Freeze.

<h1>MEMORY FORENSIC & ANALYSIS- LIVE ACQUISITION OF MEMORY</h1>
Memory forensics is forensic analysis of a computer's memory dump. Its primary application is investigation of advanced computer attacks which are stealthy enough to avoid leaving data on the computer's hard drive. Consequently, the memory must be analyzed for forensic information. We follow following steps which include Acquisition of memory, Analyzing the acquired data, Recovering the evidence for which we use tools like Magnet RAM Capture v1.2, Dump IT, Redline v2.0, Magnet AXIOM v4.10, Hexeditor.

<h1>LIVE FORENSIC OF SYSTEM (Laptop, Desktop)</h1>
Live Forensic includes assessing a system without performing imaging on it, whenever the live forensic activity is conducted it doesn't incllude recovering of Deleted files, Deleted history, Uninstalled softwares, Removed Registry Keys. While conducting Live forensic, we will be utilizing couple of tools including Process Hacker, SysInternal Tools, Autopsy.

<h1>DATA COMPROMISE ASSESSMENT</h1>
Compromise assessments are high-level investigations where skilled teams utilize advanced tools to dig more deeply into their environment to identify ongoing or past attacker activity in addition to identifying existing weaknesses in controls and practices. The tools which may conduct compromise assessment of an operating system includes Crowdinspect tool, Network Miner, Wireshark, Netstat timestamp for data compromise assessment and after performing actions we are able to gather information and vulnerabilities.
